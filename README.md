## Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project

The idea behind this project is to perform customer segmentation based on historical data provided by Arvato Financial Solutions.

We need to analyze a "CUSTOMERS" dataset and figure out how customers are similar to or differ from the general population at large ("AZDIAS" dataset). Then, using information from that analysis, we need to make predictions on users who were target of a marketing campaign ("MAILOUT" dataset).
