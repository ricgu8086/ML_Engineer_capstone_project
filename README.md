## Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project

This is the final project of the Machine Learning Engineer Udacity program.

---

The idea behind this project is to perform customer segmentation based on historical data provided by Arvato Financial Solutions.

We need to analyze a "CUSTOMERS" dataset and figure out how customers are similar to or differ from the general population at large ("AZDIAS" dataset). Then, using information from that analysis, we need to make predictions on users who were the target of a marketing campaign ("MAILOUT" dataset).

Files and directories:

* **Proposal**: it contains the proposal of the project submitted to Udacity prior to begin with the project. It details previous research, ideas and methods to tackle this project.
* **Reports**: this folder contains the automated analysis of the datasets done with the [Pandas-Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) tool.
* **Notebooks**: the gross of the project. Here are included the Jupyter notebooks used to analyze the data, preprocess, transform etc. Some models were trained both for the customer segmentation report and for the Kaggle submission task. While the [results of the submission to the challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/leaderboard
) were not astonishing, it was a very good first iteration to know the data and the challenge at hand.

**Disclaimer**: the dataset is private and can not be shared as stated by Udacity's rules.
